# FriendFinder

#### University of Utah Coding Bootcamp.  

# Overview
In this activity we built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application: a dating app. The full-stack site takes in results from the user surveys, then compare their answers with other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
